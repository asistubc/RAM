She’s a talented young chef, she runs a successful restaurant, and she has big plans to open an even better one. Then, all at once, progress on the new location bogs down, her charming ex-boyfriend pops up, her fling with another chef goes sour, and her best waitress gets badly hurt. And just like that, Katie’s life goes from pretty good to not so much. What she needs is a second chance. Everybody deserves one, after all—but they don’t come easy. Luckily for Katie, a mysterious girl appears in the middle of the night with simple instructions for a do-it-yourself do-over:<br>  <br> 1. <em>Write your mistake</em><br> 2. <em>Ingest one mushroom</em><br> 3. <em>Go to sleep</em><br> 4. <em>Wake anew</em><br>  <br> And just like that, all the bad stuff never happened, and Katie is given another chance to get things right.

In the last decade these machines have started to rapidly disappear, causing an eclectic group of individuals from around the world to come together and respond. Illustrator, writer and long-time photobooth lover, Meags Fitzgerald has chronicled this movement and the photobooth's fortuitous history in a graphic novel. Having traveled in North America, Europe and Australia, she's constructed a biography of the booth through the eyes of technicians, owners, collectors, artists and fanatics.

She was put into an induced coma and placed on life support. Days later - the night before New Year's Eve - the Dunnes were just sitting down to dinner after visiting the hospital when John suffered a massive and fatal coronary.<br><br>In a second, this close, symbiotic partnership of 40 years was over. Four weeks later, their daughter pulled through. Two months after that, arriving at LA airport, she collapsed and underwent six hours of brain surgery at UCLA Medical Centre to relieve a massive hematoma.<br><br>This powerful book is Didion's 'attempt to make sense of the weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I ever had about death, about illness, about marriage and children and memory, about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself'.

Only his second collection (the first was <em>Dark Carnival</em>, later reworked into <em>The October Country</em>), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \"The Veldt,\" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or \"Kaleidoscope,\" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or \"Zero Hour,\" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now. <em>--Stanley Wiater</em><br><br>Contents:<br><br>· Prologue: The Illustrated Man · ss * <br>· The Veldt [“The World the Children Made”] · ss The Saturday Evening Post Sep 23 ’50 <br>· Kaleidoscope · ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Oct ’49 <br>· The Other Foot · ss New Story Magazine Mar ’51 <br>· The Highway [as by Leonard Spalding] · ss Copy Spr ’50 <br>· The Man · ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Feb ’49 <br>· The Long Rain [“Death-by-Rain”] · ss Planet Stories Sum ’50 <br>· The Rocket Man · ss Maclean’s Mar 1 ’51 <br>· The Fire Balloons [“‘In This Sign...’”] · ss Imagination Apr ’51 <br>· The Last Night of the World · ss Esquire Feb ’51 <br>· The Exiles [“The Mad Wizards of Mars”] · ss Maclean’s Sep 15 ’49; F&amp;SF Win ’50 <br>· No Particular Night or Morning · ss * <br>· The Fox and the Forest [“To the Future”] · ss Colliers May 13 ’50 <br>· The Visitor · ss Startling Stories Nov ’48 <br>· The Concrete Mixer · ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Apr ’49 <br>· Marionettes, Inc.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life.

The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long.

While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.<br><br>~from author's web site"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["589"],"name":["Orson Scott Card"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1294099952p5/589.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1294099952p2/589.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/589.Orson_Scott_Card"],"average_rating":["4.06"],"ratings_count":["1915485"],"text_reviews_count":["84273"]}]}],"published":["1994"]},{"id":[{"_":"21979832","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0062380753"],"isbn13":["9780062380753"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"643","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Girl from Everywhere (The Girl from Everywhere, #1)"],"image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1434729653m/21979832.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1434729653s/21979832.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21979832-the-girl-from-everywhere"],"num_pages":["464"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Greenwillow Books"],"publication_day":["16"],"publication_year":["2016"],"publication_month":["2"],"average_rating":["3.74"],"ratings_count":["2191"],"description":["Nix has spent her entire life aboard her father’s ship, sailing across the centuries, across the world, across myth and imagination.<br><br>As long as her father has a map for it, he can sail to any time, any place, real or imagined: nineteenth-century China, the land from <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em>, a mythic version of Africa.
