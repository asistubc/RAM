Only his second collection (the first was <em>Dark Carnival</em>, later reworked into <em>The October Country</em>), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as \"The Veldt,\" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or \"Kaleidoscope,\" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship. Or \"Zero Hour,\" in which invading aliens have discovered a most logical ally--our own children. Even though most were written in the 1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly effective 50 years from now. <em>--Stanley Wiater</em><br><br>Contents:<br><br>Â· Prologue: The Illustrated Man Â· ss * <br>Â· The Veldt [âThe World the Children Madeâ] Â· ss The Saturday Evening Post Sep 23 â50 <br>Â· Kaleidoscope Â· ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Oct â49 <br>Â· The Other Foot Â· ss New Story Magazine Mar â51 <br>Â· The Highway [as by Leonard Spalding] Â· ss Copy Spr â50 <br>Â· The Man Â· ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Feb â49 <br>Â· The Long Rain [âDeath-by-Rainâ] Â· ss Planet Stories Sum â50 <br>Â· The Rocket Man Â· ss Macleanâs Mar 1 â51 <br>Â· The Fire Balloons [ââIn This Sign...ââ] Â· ss Imagination Apr â51 <br>Â· The Last Night of the World Â· ss Esquire Feb â51 <br>Â· The Exiles [âThe Mad Wizards of Marsâ] Â· ss Macleanâs Sep 15 â49; F&amp;SF Win â50 <br>Â· No Particular Night or Morning Â· ss * <br>Â· The Fox and the Forest [âTo the Futureâ] Â· ss Colliers May 13 â50 <br>Â· The Visitor Â· ss Startling Stories Nov â48 <br>Â· The Concrete Mixer Â· ss Thrilling Wonder Stories Apr â49 <br>Â· Marionettes, Inc.

First, her fearsome uncle, Lord Asriel, appears with evidence of mystery and danger in the far North, including photographs of a mysterious celestial phenomenon called Dust and the dim outline of a city suspended in the Aurora Borealis that he suspects is part of an alternate universe. He leaves Lyra in the care of Mrs. Coulter, an enigmatic scholar and explorer who offers to give Lyra the attention her uncle has long refused her. In this multilayered narrative, however, <em>nothing</em> is as it seems. Lyra sets out for the top of the world in search of her kidnapped playmate, Roger, bearing a rare truth-telling instrument, the alethiometer. All around her children are disappearingâvictims of so-called \"Gobblers\"âand being used as subjects in terrible experiments that separate humans from their daemons, creatures that reflect each person's inner being.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.<br><br>But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.<br><br>~from author's web site"],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["589"],"name":["Orson Scott Card"],"role":[""],"image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1294099952p5/589.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"small_image_url":[{"_":"\nhttp://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1294099952p2/589.jpg\n","$":{"nophoto":"false"}}],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/589.Orson_Scott_Card"],"average_rating":["4.06"],"ratings_count":["1915485"],"text_reviews_count":["84273"]}]}],"published":["1994"]},{"id":[{"_":"21979832","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0062380753"],"isbn13":["9780062380753"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"643","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Girl from Everywhere (The Girl from Everywhere, #1)"],"image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1434729653m/21979832.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1434729653s/21979832.jpg"],"large_image_url":[""],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21979832-the-girl-from-everywhere"],"num_pages":["464"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[""],"publisher":["Greenwillow Books"],"publication_day":["16"],"publication_year":["2016"],"publication_month":["2"],"average_rating":["3.74"],"ratings_count":["2191"],"description":["Nix has spent her entire life aboard her fatherâs ship, sailing across the centuries, across the world, across myth and imagination.<br><br>As long as her father has a map for it, he can sail to any time, any place, real or imagined: nineteenth-century China, the land from <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em>, a mythic version of Africa.
